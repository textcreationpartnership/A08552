         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I have preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to publiſh this ſmall Treatiſe, not expecting by thus doing to gaine either riches or preferment, I having of the former to content me, and of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by your Lordſhips favour to the utmoſt pitch (if not further) that I expected: nor hunting after or hoping hereby to have credit and applauſe (I uſually<note place="margin">Iohn 7. 14.</note> living ſolitarily and retiredly at home) well knowing that reputation is but a weake and wavering foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that peoples affections oft raiſe mens hopes, and ruine their perſons, and that wiſe men are not moved by rumours, ſince they grow by reports, and diminiſh by experience: and ſince that long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of a thing ſlakes the wonderment, and makes the wings of report to flag. But for the aforeſaid cauſes and conſiderations, as alſo to do or attempt the doing of good in the Church and my native Countrey, well knowing that good intentions (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept from ſelfe-perſwaſions againſt Gods comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements which are meere impieties) have ſuch a ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy with Gods own diſpoſition, that he will both aſſiſt them for their better encouragement, and for others example; and well knowing that as a ſcout may upon an occaſion heare and know what a whole hoſt hath no preſent notice of; ſo I (who am no
<pb facs="tcp:13975:4"/> more a ſtranger in diverſe difficulties and diſtreſſes of Chriſtianity, and in many miſeries of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, than he who in a ſhip as a paſſenger, when it is in danger declares the ſame although no Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot) have aſſayed, what in me is, the good of others, deſiring (and yet it is a folly to wiſh where there is no hope) that this which I have penned for publike profit might pleaſe all: But alas to have expected to pleaſe all men, I might rather have wiſhed (as I do no more) than imagined any poſſibility. Neither ſhall I much regard the malevolent bitings of envious carpers of other mens Writings. May it pleaſe your Lordſhip to take in good part this unfained teſtimony of mine ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequious love, officious ſervice, and humble thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe unto your Honour (which I hope you will doe, ſince noble hearts take more thankfully that which a man deſires to give, than that he gives in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed) as alſo to ſuffer this Treatiſe to paſſe under your Lordſhips noble protection and patrocinie. To whom I preſent with my humble ſervice this ſmall Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Not onely becauſe true Nobility grac'd with vertue and piety, are all combin'd in your Lordſhip Honours, Authoritie, and great places the top of the deſires of ambitious men, except they light on a nature of ſingular moderation, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter matter to great and grievous vices: to whom it is as little benefit and true content to have ſuch height of earthly happineſſe, wanting the uſe of them, as for a purblinde man to have goodly pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, and dimme eyes to behold them. In the midſt of their plenty and redundance they wanting
<pb facs="tcp:13975:5"/> the true comfort of conſcience, and the right uſe of their honour and high places, they are in the height of miſery. For, were they able to drinke up the pleaſure of the world in as plentifull manner as <hi>Cleopatra</hi> (who drunk the value of 50000 pound) at a draught; yet it is but a draught, and quickly downe; themſelves being like to greene and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly boughs and branches, cut downe from trees to adorne mens houſes for a time, and then throwne to the dunghill. For, if all the gravell in their ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers were turned into pearles, and every ſhower of raine from the clouds above were a ſhower of ſilver and gold into their houſes: yet as the freſh rivers run into and end in the ſalt ſea, ſo ſhall all their honour end in baſeneſſe, all their pleaſures in bitterneſſe, all their treaſure in emptineſſe, all their garments in nakedneſſe, and their viands and delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies in loathſomneſſe and rottenneſſe. Were they faſtned to their greatneſſe as are the ſtony moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines to their foundations; yet are they not of power ſufficient to withſtand the power of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly IEHOVAH, who commandeth the ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening and ſendeth forth the wind, and is able to ſhake the world and rend in ſunder the maſſe of the earth. Yea the faireſt and goodlieſt in body being ungodly, ſtand in danger of grievous diſeaſes, or of vile creatures to be conſumed: the ſoundeſt of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding to be tormented in mind: the richeſt in treaſures to be ſpoiled in an houre: the beſt in health to be delivered to many and ſtrong deaths, not fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red or ſuſpected. And therefore as <hi>Damocles</hi> when he ſaw nothing but his golden pots, his princely and
<pb facs="tcp:13975:5"/> magnificent entertainment, his royall attendants, thought himſelfe moſt happy; but when he caſt up his eyes and ſaw a naked ſword hanging onely by a horſe haire ready every minute to fall upon his head, then he began to tremble. Even ſo theſe great and graceleſſe men of the world, when they onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect their pomp, they think there are none like them. But when they looke up to the great vault of heaven, and ſee the juſt God ready to powre downe his vials of vengeance on them, then they tremble. Whereas your Lordſhips humble de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment in ſuch ſublimities, digeſting great felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty without ſurfet (a rare vertue in great perſons) the many radiant and reſplendent gifts and graces, for which D. <hi>Hart,</hi> and M. <hi>Bolton,</hi> and others, in their Dedicatory Epiſtles, have ſpread your honour and renowne, yet report was leſſe than verity, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne farre ſhort of deſert: for truth doth out-ſtrip fame, and many other I would name, were I not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to ſpeake of them as they deſerve, and in what I can unworthy; and did I not know how averſe ſuch praiſes are unto your Honour, accounting per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall commendations of living great ones, in men of our ſort, a verball ſimony, eternize your memory, and make you bleſſed to all eternity.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Not only becauſe of your Lordſhips noble Patronage of all good learning, ſo far forth as to be a bountifull and perpetuall benefactour to the breeding and training up of ſchollers in good litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in a free and bountifull beſtowing of Church-li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings in your Lordſhips Patronage, but alſo in ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſingular regard and reſpect to the Miniſters of the

            <p>Thirdly, Not onely becauſe of your Honours preſence at the preaching of many of theſe Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons in our Lecture much countenanced and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by your Lordſhips not onely often, but uſuall and ordinary frequenting the ſame.</p>

And thus good Chriſtian Reader, hoping thou wilt take in good part that which with no little paines I have penned for publike good. I commend thee to God and the Word of his grace, and remaine</p>

Yet partly in regard of the little reſpect the ſouldier hath, by meanes of our long peacefull ſecurity; and the many diſorders and outrages acted by that profeſſion, (which cannot probably be otherwiſe, whiles election of men for warre is uſed as a dreyne to vent away the refuſe and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered people) partly in regard of mens womaniſh <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Concerning the former, I ceaſe to ſay any more, leaving it to them whom it concernes to worke out of people this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred cowardize, to infuſe into them courage for Gods and their Countreyes cauſe, and to reſtore the martiall mens eſteeme (by better choice, diſcipline and countenance) to its priſtine repute, theſe being a defence to our lives and

               <head type="sub">Christianity is a warfare.</head>
               <p>CHriſtianity is a warfare, wherein the Chriſtian doth (as <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>2</label> he ought of duty) warre a good warfare: 2 <hi>Cor. 10. 3, 4. For though we walke in the fleſh, we do not warre after the fleſh, for the weapons of our warfare are not carnall,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Eph. 6. 11, 12. Put you on the whole armour of God, for we wrestle not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst fleſh and bloud, but againſt,</hi> &amp;c. 2 <hi>Tim. 2 3. Thou there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as a good ſouldier of Christ. 2 Tim. 4. 7. I have fought a good fight. Hebr. 10. 32. Fight of afflictions. 1 Tim. 6. 12. Good fight of faith.</hi> Or if you pleaſe, I will divide this into three branches. Chriſtianity is a warfare. 2 <hi>Cor. 10. 3. Eph.</hi> 6. 11, 12.</p>
               <p>Thoſe whoſe condition, calling and profeſſion is to fight <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>1</label> againſt the enemies of Chriſt and his Church, their life is a warfare, and they are ſouldiers.</p>
               <p>But the condition, calling and profeſſion of Chriſtians is to fight againſt the enemies of Chriſt and his Church.</p>
               <p>Therefore the life of Chriſtians is a warfare, and they are ſouldiers.</p>
               <p>The latter propoſition is evident by the many ſacred injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in holy writ, to fight the good fight of faith, 1 <hi>Tim. 6. 12. 2 Tim. 2. 3, &amp;c.</hi> By the examples of Gods Saints in all ages: <hi>Adam</hi> foyled in Paradiſe: <hi>Iob</hi> tempted and tryed by the utmoſt of Satans cruelties: <hi>Peter</hi> winnowed; <hi>Paul</hi> buffeted, and fighting a good fight. And by the admittance of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans into the Church by baptiſme, wherein they receive as it were preſſe-money, and promiſe manfully to fight under the banner of Chriſt crucified, againſt ſinne, the world and the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell, and to continue Chriſts faithfull ſervants and ſouldiers to their lives end.</p>
               <p>Thoſe whoſe Lord is a Lord of hoſts, ſouldiers and armies, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> themſelves being part of his hoſt and army, muſt needs be ſouldiers, and their life a warfare:</p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:13975:14"/>
               <p>But the Lord of Chriſtians is a Lord of hoſts, ſouldiers and armies, themſelves being part of his hoſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 80, 4, 7, 14, 19. 84. 1, 3, 8, 12.</p>
               <p>Therefore they muſt needs be ſouldiers, and their life a warfare.</p>
               <p>That which agreeth with warfare in all reſpects, is a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> warfare.</p>
               <p>But Chriſtianity agreeth with warfare in all reſpects. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as in warfare, ſo in this,</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is a place of conflict, namely the Chriſtian Church Militant in this world, <hi>Rev. 12. 7. There was warre in heaven.</hi> Not in that third and higheſt heaven, where God dwelleth and raigneth, the ſeat and manſion of bleſſed Angels and godly men; for there is no fighting, but all peace: and the Dragon was caſt from thence in the beginning. But in the viſible Church, the heaven upon earth: called heaven, it being a lively picture and image of heaven, the habitation of glorified Saints.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There are enemies to fight. For, ſince the fall of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, 1. There have beene, and while the world ſtands there will be two ſides in the Church militant, the ſeed of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and the ſerpents; twixt which there is conſtant enmity, <hi>Gen. 3. 15. Michael</hi> and the Dragon who are alwayes in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 7. The Spirit and the fleſh, 'twixt which there is an irreconciliable jarre and contrariety, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 7. God and Mammon, both which none can ſerve and obey, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 24. 2. And the true Church upon earth hath alwaies had, and ſhall alwaies have adverſaries and enemies. They not being of the world, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 19. They being choſen out of the world, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 19. They reproving the world, teſtifying that the deeds thereof are evill, <hi>Iohn</hi> 7. 7. They being the womans ſeed, and borne after the Spirit.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There are Generals, Captaines and Commanders, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whoſe conduct and guidance, at whoſe appointment and for whoſe ſake the ſouldiers fight.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the Chriſtians Generals and Commanders are</p>
               <p n="1">1. God the Father, who is therefore called uſually in
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:13975:14"/> Scripture, a Lord of hoſts, becauſe all creatures are under his power and diſpoſition, as an hoſt of ſouldiers under their Emperour. By him we pull down ſtrong holds, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alting againſt God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4, 5. And with his armour we fight, <hi>Eph</hi> 6. 11, 13.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Chriſt Ieſus who is their couragious Captaine, 2 <hi>Cor. 10. 5. to the obedience of Chriſt. 2 Tim. 2. 3. As a good ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier of Christ. Rev. 12. 7. Michael, .i.</hi> Chriſt Ieſus that ſtrong and mighty Prince and Captaine of the hoſt of God, <hi>Ioſh.</hi> 5. 13, 15.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the enemies prime leader and commander is the Divell, <hi>Iam. 4. 7. Reſist the Divell. Rev. 12. 7. The Dragon fought and his angels: .i.</hi> The Divell (likened to a Dragon in regard of his terrible fierceneſſe) who is the prince of that ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my which maintaineth warre againſt Chriſt, <hi>Rev. 20. 2. The Dragon which is the Divell.</hi> As for the king of thoſe dreadfull and helliſh locuſts, the angels of the bottomleſſe pit, <hi>Rev.</hi> 9. 11. the monſtrous prevailing beaſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 1, 2. they are but the Divels ſubſtitutes.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There are ordinary ſouldiers in each band, namely every Saint, every wicked one: there are horſmen and chariots of each ſide: namely,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Able and faithfull Magiſtrates and Miniſters; who like valiant horſmen and commanders put themſelves in danger, firſt running upon the pikes to rout the enemies and break their ranks; to reſcue and deliver, to ſave and defend Gods people, are worthily called <hi>the chariots and horſmen of Iſrael, 2 King.</hi> 2. 12.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And all true profeſſours which are faithfull family-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, who (like inferiour officers) are helpers to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named, <hi>Rom. 16. 9. 1 Cor.</hi> 16. 16.</p>
               <p n="1">1. With their prayers (<hi>Epheſ. 6. 18, 19. Pray for all Saints and for me. 1 Tim. 2. 1, 2. Pray for Kings and all all that are in authority</hi>) in their Magiſtracy and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery.</p>

               <p n="5">5. As in warfare, ſo in Chriſtianity there is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat

Of righteouſneſſe, 2 Corinth.</hi> 6. 7. And weapons defenſive and offenſive: 2 <hi>Corinth. 10. 3.

               <p>HOw ridiculous and abſurdly fooliſh, yet much to be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented is the groundleſſe fancy and idle conceipt of thoſe men, who crowne themſelves with pleaſant garlands of reſtfull ſecurity, and pleaſurefull delights, imagining they may go to heaven (as it were) in a bed of downe and exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive jollity; thinking it the eaſieſt matter of twenty to go to Church, to receive the Communion, ſay over a few pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, to deſie the Divell and all his workes, and to cry God mercy for their prodigious oathes, mercileſſe uſury, ſatanicall lies, and other their bloudy and crimſon, conſtantly commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and continually crying impieties; little conſidering that they are but in a fooles paradiſe, dreaming altogether of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibilities. For to pray, heare, receive the Sacraments, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, &amp;c. aright, or to be a through ſincere Chriſtian, is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of great difficulty, and no little danger, of much hardſhip and no eaſie labour. To profeſſe ſouldioury, being a wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering runnagado, to enjoy a ſouldiers ſtipend and title with a manumiſſion to ſolace a mans ſelfe with friends and familiars: to be a billited ſouldier, or maintained in gariſon: to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trencht in field farre remote from dreadfull foes, are eaſefull,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:13975:18"/> and neither toyleſome nor troubleſome conditions. But to be drawne out to march in battell array, to encounter an impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, inexorable, puiſſant and bloud-thirſty enemy, not onely to skirmiſh a little, but to fight it out pel mel, each ſide being forced to imploy its beſt and utmoſt warlike skill, ſtrength and valour to vanquiſh and deſtroy the other, is (I ſuppoſe) an eſtate full of dreadfull feares, ſolicitous cares, painefull la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, exceſſive diligence, and watchfull vigilance.</p>
               <p>The caſe is thine, O thou that art a true Chriſtian. Thou haſt received preſſe-money from Chriſt thy Captaine: thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion is to be his ſouldier, than which, what eſtate more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficill? What condition more painefull? What life more la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourſome? Where there are fightings without, and combats within: where thine enemies are not few, but many: not feeble, but mighty: not meeke, but truculent: not exorable, but implacable: not fleſh and bloud, but principalities and powers: not men onely, but Divels alſo. And is it an eaſie matter to be a Chriſtian? Are eaſefull idleneſſe and careleſſe ſecurity congruent conſorts for Chriſtianity think you? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly no. It is a harder matter to leave and abandon ſinne, to make progreſſe in piety, to live truly a Chriſtian life, to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the fleſh, to crucifie the world, and reſiſt the Divell: to pray for enemies and perſecutors, to repay benedictions for maledictions, to deny our ſelves, to beare the croſſe, to forſake all, &amp;c. than many vaine dreamers imagine. I ſpeak not theſe things to daunt or diſmay any: (for I hope to make it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently apparent, that the weakeſt warriour of the Lord Ieſus that will be counſelled, ſhall victoriouſly vanquiſh) but to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake ſuch doting dreamers, who are lull'd aſleepe in Satans ſhackles, preferring a little dangerous eaſe-ſeeming ſecurity in the Divels ſlaviſh enthralments, before a little happy and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving laborious diligence in the Lords army.</p>

It is good for me that I have beene afflicted.</hi> And of that mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous ſouldier of God the Prophet <hi>Ieremie, Lament. 3. 27. It is good for a man to beare the yoke from his youth.</hi> Namely for a man which is elected, which is the faithfull ſervant of GOD, and ſouldier of CHRIST, who is armed with the armour of GOD, and indued with faith,

                  <p>Thirdly, Whether it be true or no (I know not) that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded of the Muſcovians, that it is holden for a great grace in Muſcovia for a ſervant to be ſtricken of his maſter, a wife of her husband, or a Noble of the great Duke. For if any of the Nobles happen to be ſtricken with a cudgell, he replies, <hi>Health and ſafety attend you my Lord and great King, who haſt vouchſafed to reclaime me by theſe ſtripes.</hi> Yet I am ſure that renownefull honour is from hence.

                  <p>Yet in truth the words containe a double dehortation, from a double extremity, in a double vertue inforced by a double reaſon drawne from a double danger, or diſcommodity de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending upon the foreſaid extremities.</p>
                  <p>There is a double righteouſneſſe or juſtice.</p>

                  <p>All their ſinnes are pardoned, yet not ſo as to free them from ſinne in this life; for although the children of God have<note place="margin">Perk.

Should a man inferre that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in Gods decree all men ſhall die and come to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that therefore all men are dead and come to judgement. Should a man inferre that becauſe in reſpect of Gods promiſe, in reſpect of the procurement the Saints are glorified, that therefore the Saints who are under trials of cruell mockings,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:13975:79"/> and ſcourgings; yea moreover, in bonds and impriſonments, who wander in ſheeps skins and goats skins, being deſtitute, afflicted, and tormented, and they who as yet are unborne, and never ſaw the Sun, are already actually glorified in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.

                  <p>I therefore (ſince this their inference is as imprudent and improbable, as incongruous, and inconſiderate) heartily and humbly wiſh and deſire theſe ſilly deluded ſoules to lay aſide their owne ſelfe-conceiptedneſſe and ſelfe-juſtice, to diſcerne and deplore their owne diſabilities, and deſiſt from diſturbing the Church with their diſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>onant diſtractions.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I haue clearely manifeſted the differences and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greements betweene the juſtified Iewes and Chriſtians to be ſuch, that the covenant betweene the Lord, them and us, is one and the ſame, according to the Doctrine of our Church,<note place="margin">Hom. of faith, B. 1.</note> which ſaith, <hi>Although they were not named Chriſten men, yet was it a Christian faith that they had; for they looked for all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of God the Father through the merits of his Sonne Ieſus Chriſt as we do. This difference is betweene them and us; for, they looked when Chriſt ſhould come, and we be in the time when he is come: Therefore ſaith S.</hi> Auguſtine, <hi>the time is altered, but not the faith: for we have both one faith in one Chriſt, the ſame Holy Ghoſt alſo that we have, had they, ſaith S.</hi> Paul; <hi>for, as the Holy Ghost doth teach us to truſt in God, and to call upon him as our Father: ſo did he teach them to ſay as it is written, Thou Lord art our Father and Redeemer, thy Name is without</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iſa. 43.</note> 
                     <hi>beginning, and everlaſting. God gave them then grace to be his children, as he doth us now,</hi> againſt the gaineſayings of theſe contradicting cavillers.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I have clearly proved that obedience to Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts<note place="margin">Book 3. Cap. 14. pag. 179.</note> is one meanes whereby we keepe covenant with God, and therefore a part of the covenant of grace; which theſe igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly condemne as falſe, ſpeaking evill of thoſe things which they know not; for did they but underſtand what this covenant
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:13975:80"/> is betweene God and his people; namely Gods contract with them concerning the obtaining of eternall life: did they but know that this covenant conſiſts of two parts, Gods promiſe to them, <hi>ſc.</hi> to give them Chriſt and his benefits, as remiſſion of ſinnes and ſalvation, to be their God, and to ſave them, to deale mercifully and truly with them: and theirs to God, <hi>ſc.</hi> to be his people and to ſerve him, to repent of their ſinnes, and receive Chriſt by faith, to yeeld obedience to his will; did they but know that univerſall obedience is, if not the ſubſtance of this covenant on the Saints part, yet the principall part thereof, as is evident, <hi>Exod 19. 8. Nehem. 10. 28. Ezra</hi> 10. 3. They would not ſo wickedly and wilfully with ſuch prepoſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous prejudice perverſly pronounce this orthodoxe truth: The Law of God is part of the covenant of grace, ungrounded, and erroneous.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, I have expreſly evidence, that the Saints of<note place="margin">Book 3. Cap. 16. pag. 194. Book 4. Cap. 5. pag. 230.</note> God ought to feare, as well as love the Lord, contrary to their perverſe poſition, that love and feare cannot ſtand toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, I have delineated and deſcribed the inamouring<note place="margin">Book 4. Cap. 5. pag. 237.</note> excellency, and inevitable neceſſity of ſanctification, againſt the irreligious and reproachfull, diabolicall and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous barkings againſt the ſame, ſome of their fraternity (as I have heard reported) terming it ſcurvy ſanctification.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, I have ſhewed the extent and excellency of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an<note place="margin">Book 4. Cap. 6. pag. 242.</note> liberty, wherein I have contradicted and confuted their lawleſſe and licentious liberty.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, I have opened and unfolded the doctrine of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification,<note place="margin">Book 4 Cap. 5. pag. 233.</note> to informe and teach them the truth of that of which they talk, and talk ſo much to little purpoſe, in which they would ſeeme wondrous wiſe, although they wander wide of the way.</p>
                  <p>Eightly, Although their tenet of Gods not afflicting his children for their ſinnes is ſo repugnant to the regall rule of ſacred Writ, and ſo ridiculous to rectified reaſon, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating is a ſufficient refutation thereof: Yet I much bewailing their err<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Furthermore, becauſe I ſuppoſe theſe cavillers will carpe againſt all theſe allegations as inſufficient and weake, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in none of them we are ſaid to be bound by the Law to obedience. I will therefore ſhew them theſe expreſſe words in ſacred Scripture, if that will ſatisfie and ſalve their ſeduced ſoules, 1 <hi>Corinth. 7. 15. A brother or ſister is not under bondage in ſuch caſes;</hi> namely, to performe matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall duties to unbelieveing yoke-fellowes which will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from, and forſake them, Verſ. 27. <hi>Art then bound to a wife? Seeke not to be looſed.</hi> Verſ. 39. <hi>The wife is bound by the Law, as long as her husband liveth.</hi> Hence I inferre, That ſince the Law of God doth binde the believing husband and wife to performe all manner of matrimoniall duties to their unbelieving yoke-fellowes which are pleaſed to dwell with them, and that ſince the husband and wife being regenerate, are bound by the Law each to other ſo long as they live toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; therefore that part of the Law which doth compriſe and comprehend the duties of husbands and wives each to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, namely the fift and ſeventh commandements, doth bind the conſcience of the regenerate to obedience; therefore either all the Morall Law doth bind, or els that this branch of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Table is more authenticall, and of more abſolute authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, not only than all the ſecond Table beſides, but alſo than the firſt Table; yet our Saviour ſaith the ſecond is but like unto the firſt, ſtiling it the firſt and great commandement, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 38.</p>

How can hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands and wives be perſwaded of conjugall love and fidelity from ſuch yoke-fellowes? How can traders and traffiquers be aſcertained of true and honeſt dealing from ſuch people, who are conceited that the Law of God doth not bind them to obedience? Oh that theſe beguiled and unſtable ſoules would queſtion and conferre after this or the like manner with their conſciences. Tell me Conſcience, are not murders, adulteries, thefts, and ſuch like ſinnes, and why? Tell me Conſcience, how thou knoweſt that lying, ſwearing, evill thoughts, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence and the like, are ſinnes? Tell me Conſcience, whence is it that thou wilt not allow me to ſteale, kill, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit adulterie, or the like? And their conſciences (except they lie in a lethall lethargie) will anſwer. Not onely are thefts, murders, and adulteries ſinnes, but alſo covetous deſires, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adviſed anger, and luſtfull thoughts, becauſe they are a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of Gods Law. I know that the fore-named, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther workes of darkeneſſe are ſinnes, becauſe the Law of God forbids them. And I dare not approve of the doing of ſuch like things, becauſe they are contrary to, and condemned by the moſt holy and heavenly Law of God.

                  <head type="sub">Why we ſhould pray for Kings and all that are in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and for what, why for Paſtours and for what, why for our Children, and why alſo for enemies.</head>
                  <p>THus pray we not onely for our ſelves, but alſo for all men, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 1. namely which are capable of ſuch gifts, graces, and good things which we pray for: Three ſorts are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of the graces Gods people petition principally for. To wit, The damned in hell. The dead in Chriſt, and the deſperate impenitent ſinner, who ſins the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, and therefore theſe are not to be prayed for.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The damned are capable of no grace, no good, no mercy, no favour. <hi>Dives</hi> deſired but one drop of water to comfort and coole his tongue burning and broiling in thoſe intollerable and infernall flames, and could not obtaine ſo ſmall a favour.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The dead in Chriſt are deſtitute of no grace, goodneſſe, freedome, favour, honour, or happineſſe, they enjoying to all eternity ſuch and ſo many glorious bleſſedneſſes, that the heart of man cannot conceive or imagine, much leſſe can the tongue of men and Angels expreſſe, and declare the ſame.</p>
                  <p>To pray for the firſt ſort of theſe is frivolous, and fruitleſſe. To pray for the latter is needleſſe, and unneceſſary; and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to doe good to either.</p>

                  <p>To pray therefore for either is ſinfull, and unlawfull; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe unneceſſary and unprofitable, becauſe it is not of faith: for faith, and every article of faith muſt be grounded upon Gods Word and Canonicall Scripture. But to beleeve that the dead are to be prayed for is not grounded on the ſacred Word of God, there being in the Canonicall Scripture to warrant the ſame neither Teſtimony or precept, Example or practiſe, Promiſe of reward, nor puniſhment threatned for the neglect thereof.</p>
                  <p>Therefore ſuch prayer is Impious, becauſe no where war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable. Hurtfull (becauſe ſinfull) to the petitioner. Need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe if in heaven. Vnprofitable if in hell. Impoſſible to doe good whereſoever therefore not of faith, and utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull.</p>

                  <p>Fourthly, By praying for them; for ought we to pray for all men, how much more for our children, bone of our bone
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:13975:139"/> and fleſh of our fleſh, whom we have impoyſoned and pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with divers defiling diſtainings of originall and actuall contagious ſins and tranſgreſſions. They being alſo to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, not ſome effeminate and womaniſh forces, nor onely ſome forcible and furious foes with a few ſhort skirmiſhing excurſions. But to enter Pel Mel into this Chriſtian warfare without any exception or truce. In which they muſt continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally conflict with and confront enemies unparaleld for power, puiſſance and pollicy, for cruelty, craft and cunning without intermiſſion and interruption untill at death they having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered ſhall be crowned.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Pray we not onely for friends and favourites, kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and acquaintance, neighbours and neare allyes, whom God hath linked to us by naturall and civill bonds and liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The Lord having knit and conjoyned us by theſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ties for the mutuall good one of another, and that wee might be helpefull each to other. But alſo for ſtrangers, with whom we have no acquaintance, whom wee never ſaw or knew, yea and for enemies who hate and hurt, curſe and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniate, plague, and perſecute us even unto death. Thus <hi>Abraham</hi> piouſly prayed for the wicked Sodomites, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 23. Thus to doe was expreſſely enjoyned by our Soveraigne Lord and Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 44. and piouſly practiſed by himſelfe when his enemies deviſed againſt and did him all the hurt they poſſibly could, <hi>Luke 23. 34. Father forgive them for they know not what they doe.</hi> Thus doing, we ſhall paſſe on in theſe peereleſſe paths preſcribed and pattern'd out unto us by the holy men of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 14. Bleſſe them that perſecute you. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 12. being reviled we bleſſe. <hi>Act. 7. 60. Lord lay not this ſin to their charge,</hi> was the ſweet ſwan-like ſong and patheticall petition for, and the friend-like favourable and fertile farewell of Saint <hi>Steven</hi> unto his barbarous and bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thirſty perſecutors, when they injuriouſly, injuſtly, enraged<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and inhumanely, ſavagely, and ſatanically ſtoned him; even then as he breathed out and bequeathed his ſpirit into the indiſſoluble, incorruptible, incomprehenſible, and incredibly gladſome embracings of his bleſſed Saviour whom hee ſaw
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:13975:139"/> ſtanding on the right hand of God. So for them that benigne and beneficiall benediction. Thus doing wee ſhall demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate and manifeſtly ſhew the abiding and abounding of true Chriſtian love in our hearts, this teaching and enabling us thus to overcome, and recompence, and repay evill with good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 21. Thus doing we may be a meanes of their happy converſion, ſo of inlarging the kingdome of Chriſt, of weakening the power and leſſening the number of Satans ſide, ſo of our enemies. Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> thinkes that Saint <hi>Stevens</hi> prayer was a meanes of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> comfortable and Chriſtian change: ſaying, <hi>therefore was</hi> Paul <hi>lifted up from</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ambroſ. lib. 1. cap. 9. de paeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentia.</note> 
                     <hi>the earth, becauſe</hi> Steven <hi>was bowed downe on earth and heard.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And why may not we more probably conjecture, if not conclude, that Chriſts pitifull and patheticall prayer on the Croſſe was the cauſe of the converſion and calling of many thouſand Iewes after his death and reſurrection.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Pray for all men, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 1. of what eſtate, degree, condition, or calling ſoever, be they friends or foes, good or bad, pious or prophane; If bad, that they may be called and converted; If good, that they may be ſtrengthened and eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in this warfare. <hi>Col. 1. 9. We must not deſpaire of thoſe that</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Auguſt. in Pſal. 36.</note> 
                     <hi>be evill, but we muſt more earnestly pray that they may be made good, for alwaies the number of Saints is enlarged out of the number of the wicked,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Auguſtine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. Pray extraordinarily, with more then ordinary ardency of affection, ſo as to cry mightily unto God, <hi>Ionah</hi> 3. 8. more earneſtly then at other times, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 44. with ſtrong crying, <hi>Hebrewes</hi> 5. 7. ſo as to wreſtle with God in prayer, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 24.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. At the point of death. Thus that pious Proto-martyr Saint <hi>Steven, Acts</hi> 7. 60. cryed with a loud voice. Thus that unparaleld Convert the penitent thiefe upon the Croſſe, <hi>Luke</hi> 23. 42. And our bleſſed Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27. 46. cryed with a loud voice; for uſually the tempter is then moſt trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and truculent with his laſt encounters, and moſt labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous onſets. Then are we our ſelves moſt diſabled and unfitted
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:13975:140"/> to hold up head, and hold out againſt thoſe direfull, and diſmall darts of the deſtroyer. And then our night haſtingly approacheth when we cannot worke any longer, but we muſt reſt from our labours, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 13. when we cannot ſo praiſe God, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 6. 5. as to benefit the Church and choſen of God by our prayers and other performances. It therefore behoves us; That God may have the greater honour, and glory; our ſelves obtaine more ſolace, ſtrength, and ſupport againſt the fierce and formidable farwells of our furious foes: and that we may do all the good we poſſibly may or can, before we reſt from our labours, then to double our diligence in praying unto our good, and gratious God, with vehement and violent vigour, with earneſt and unexpreſſable deſires of the heart.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In the time of dreadfull deſertions, diſaſterous diſtreſſes, direfull diſcomfitings, or any more then ordinary and uſuall dolorous occurrences. The fitteſt time for prayer being, when men are in the greateſt neceſſities, agonies, and perplexities: And amongſt all other duties of afflicted and aſſaulted ſoules, this of prayer being the moſt needfull. This is the firſt, the laſt, the beſt and ſureſt weapon for weake ſaints, ſouldiers, and Chriſtians; and the moſt ſoveraigne ſalve for all ſores, and ſaddings of body and ſoule.

Hence was it that thoſe many perplexed priſoners, who ſate in darkeneſſe, and in the ſhadow of death being bound in afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and iron—whoſe hearts were brought downe with labour, ſo that they fell downe without any to helpe them, <hi>v.</hi> 10, 11, 12.

                  <p n="1">1. For the very countenance of parents ought to be reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, amiable, yea and terrible if we offend them.</p>

                  <p>Reverence therefore and reſpect your parents. If you bee rich your parents poore, releeve them, yet with reverence, not as if you gave an almes to a beggar with an high heart, but as a termer or tenant holding in Knights ſervice payes reliefe unto his Lord, not of benevolence but of duty. If you be wiſe, learned, and politique, your parents ſimple unlearned and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, counſell, adviſe, inſtruct, and admoniſh them, yet with reverence, practiſe all your performances, doe all your duties unto your parents with reverence. Gods gifts and goodneſſe to you may not cauſe or incourage you to vitiate and violate, to infring or breake the loyall lawes of nature.</p>
                  <p>For this end and purpoſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As parents ſhould conſcionably and continually be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to procure honour, and eſteeme in their children towards them.

                  <p n="2">2. So that you may procure, purchaſe and preſerve this righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, religious, and remarkable grace in your ſelves.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Ply the throne of grace for, and labour inceſſantly to plant and preſerve, to compaſſe and cheriſh that difficult but divine grace, true humility.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And accurately acquaint your ſelves with, and acquire with all aſſiduity the knowledge of Gods ordinance, and of that authority which parents have from God, whoſe command and charge it is that you ſhould honour your parents.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, I know that all ſuperiours are meant, and called by the name father.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. As alſo to give ſuperiours an inkling to behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves like fathers, and not like raging bedlams.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I know that ſuperiours or parents duties are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in that commandement although not expreſſed, as in the fourth precept.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For ſuperiours are or ought to be obſervers and keepers of both tables, and therfore their duties are implied in each.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And the enjoyning of duties to inferiours inforceth a charge upon them, the law being two edged by the nature of relation, they therefore are commanded to honour inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours although not with reverence, yet with good uſage.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, yet the duties of inferiours of children are rather named and expreſſed then of ſuperiours and parents.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Not onely becauſe inferiours and underlings are more skillfull, and mindfull of their parents duties then their owne, this being a common ſin to be skillfull in other mens duties, and not our owne.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Not onely becauſe greater inconveniences may accrew, and diſcommodities grow by neglect of inferiours duties, as by their unrulineſſe, ſtubborneneſſe and rebellion, then by the tart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and tyranny of ſuperiours.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But alſo becauſe inferiours are more hardly, and with more difficulty brought either to the knowledge or practiſe of their offices then ſuperiours.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Or to teach them preciſely to practiſe and performe their duties diligently to their betters, although they ſhould fruſtrate their expectation and faile in theirs to them.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. As alſo to manifeſt and make knowne that all ſins com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt fellowes, or inferiours, equals, or underlings, are not ſo noyſome and notorious, not ſo great and grievous, but farre leſſe then againſt ſuperiours, the defacing of whom is a defacing of the image of God: the overthrowing and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning the order and ornament, the ſtate and ſtability of the world.</p>

                  <p>Away therefore with ſuch prepoſterous and topſi turvy practiſes and diſorderly doings of thoſe women who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand their husbands, for although ſuch women thinke it their happineſſe and honour; yet in truth it is nothing leſſe, ſuch wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men being accounted vaine, and men fooliſh, ſuch men being feminine men, women maſculine women, ſuch women being inſolent and irreligious leading the life of <hi>Achaia,</hi> as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbe

And I verily thinke that ſome one thruſt out farmer hath formerly imployed and ſet to worke as many people con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, as the greedy depopulatour doth with his decayed Lordſhip.

                  <p>Inſtead therefore of inſtigating unto, or juſtifying theſe injurious and inhumane incloſings after this or the like manner with theſe or the like poliſhing and plauſible, yet prepoſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous pretexts and pretences. For I not onely conceive and conjecture, but know what can be and is ſaid by theſe enemies of mankind, which in truth by daily experience are convinced and confuted, being manifeſted to be but falſe and fained glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zings, and deceitfull deludings to deceive and defraud ſuch who either will not or cannot dive into and diſcerne their fraud and forgery.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Whereas they affirme that the champion is bleake and <label type="milestone">

                     </label> cold; the incloſure being well fortified and fenced againſt ſuch inconveniences, nouriſhing and cheriſhing great ſtore of wood and fruit-trees in their hedge-rowes and particular fields. Experience expreſly explicates that with us the <label type="milestone">

Whereas the other wanting men and meanes to do the ſame, ſatisfie themſelves with bramble buſhes, and briarly thorny hedges, having little other wood, which are no good orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor any great ſhelter, neither do they affoord ſuch plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of fewell unto the inhabitants, but that they would willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly warme themſelves with the champ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

                     </gap> mans ſtraw as with good firing if they had it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Whereas they affirme the champion to be nothing ſo commodious or profitable, the ground by meanes of the many ditches being well dreyned and much bettered, one acre in the incloſed ground with one tillae yeelding as much, oft more increaſe than two in the champion with many times plowing. The incloſed ground being freer from rotting of ſheep, by which meanes the champion farmer is much impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſhed. The incloſing, preventing unneighbourly incroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon one another by plowing, mowing, and that unmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull and uncharitable eating up of poore men, who cannot ſtore their commons by rich neighbours, which is uſuall and common in the champion field. As alſo that incloſure im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployes the labouring men in winter as well as ſummer, in hedging and ditching. Rectified reaſon and grounded experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence manifeſts theſe to be but frivolous and trifling flouriſhes without validity. For are not the champion townes abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more commodious to the common-wealth, breeding, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining and imploying multitudes of families more than the other? Are not the champion fields (eſpecially where good husbands are) as well dreyned and dreſſed with plough and ſpade? As for the abundance of corne they boaſt of, it is onely after long reſting, not if it be continually ſeeded as the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion is: for then it could not compare with it, wanting ſheepe and other helpes the champion hath. As for their freedome from rotting, no marvell, for either lay downe the plough or part with their ſheepe. As for incroachings, there are better
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:13975:171"/> and more bleſſed meanes to order and remedy the ſame, than by ſuch a medicine farre worſe than the malady. Neither are poore men oppreſſed ſo by rich men, but that they have their bit, or money for the ſame. And I wonder with what a face any man can ſay, that by meanes of theſe hedges and ditches, the incloſure doth imploy more than the champion doth, want of imployment being one of the greateſt miſchiefes they occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the common-wealth.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Laſtly, whereas they ſay, experience in all incloſed countreyes ſhewes, that there men live more richly and farre better than in the champion. I do not wonder, ſuch townes maintaining now two or three men of faſhion, whereas for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly they maintained for the ſame twenty. I know that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of time hath skinned the skarre and healed the ſcab, ſo that we ſee them what they are, not what they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, farre more populous than now they be. But ſhew me who can in the memory of man an incloſed towne wherein ſo many (I thinke I may ſay halfe ſo many) able houſholders do now live and ſo richly as they did then when it was champion. If in a neighbouring towne in which are two hundred people leſſe, in which are three or foure ploughs where were former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſix or ſeven and thirty, thoſe few live more richly (and it is well if they do) and farre better than formerly, is (I think) no great matter.</p>
                  <p>Inſtead of thus pleading for and patronizing ſuch a curſed and cruell conſumer of the common-wealth as incloſure is, I deſire all men to conſider,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. How by this meanes whole Lordſhips are converted from tillage to paſturing: farme-houſes decayed: husbandmen turned cottagers or ſhepheards, are driven to ſeeke habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons elſwhere. Townes utterly depopulated and unpeopled, or thoſe who remaine to live for the generall in great miſery.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. How ſuch and ſo many pleaſant and commodious habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations for men, are tragically turned into rude and ruinous heapes, and the many delicate and delightfull fields plentifully abounding formerly with folds and flockes, with rich and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing fruits; deformed and defaced, laid languiſhing like
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:13975:172"/> deplored and deſolate deſarts, haunted and inhabited onely by bruit beaſts and a few ſolitary manſions remaining, where there is little help in time of neceſſity, comfort in time of doubt, or ſociety in time of peace.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. How the diſaſterous and dreadfull judgements of God have like an inviolable inundation and irrevocable irruption ſeized upon and conſumed theſe inſatiable minded men. I might here tell you what our Chronicles relate of New For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in Hamſhire, for the making whereof King <hi>William</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrew townes and villages by the ſpace of thirty miles or more, to bring the ſame into a chaſe for deere: In the ſaid Forreſt <hi>William</hi> his ſonne with an arrow in his breaſt, <hi>Richard</hi> his ſonne gored and ſpoiled by the deere, and <hi>Richard</hi> his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew the ſonne of <hi>Robert</hi> Duke of Normandy having his neck broke, or (as ſome ſay) hanged in the boughs of a tree, loſt their lives. I could deſcend to our own times, and our fathers, and ſhew you how Gods curſe hath lighted upon the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall actors in this truculent and tyrannizing tragedy. I have a catalogue of many in this kind, as <hi>C.</hi> incloſed by M. <hi>R. K.</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed by S. <hi>R. O.</hi> The two <hi>R.</hi> and <hi>H.</hi> incloſed by S. <hi>F.

                  <p n="4">4 How carefully our fore-fathers did continually prevent ſuch inconveniences, not onely by mixing and intermingling their grounds together, but by ſtrict and ſevere lawes againſt incloſure, begun in the fourth yeare of K. <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, which have beene corroborated and confirmed by his ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours in ſundry Parliaments ſince.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. What an unconceiveable difference there is betweene the towne of tillage and the incloſed.</p>

                     <p n="3">3. The Scripture never denounceth judgements againſt ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king reaſonable rents for houſes and lands.</p>

For houſe and land yeeld a fruitfull uſe ariſing from the nature of the thing, as the benefit of dwelling, trading, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but money hath no fruitfull uſe of it ſelfe, and if it is fruitfull, its wholly by the skill and induſtry of him who uſeth it, and therefore to him the gaine ought to belong.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In theſe things the uſe and not the property is alienated, and uſually they are the worſe for letting: in money the ſame money is not received but ſo much in value, and for the lending it is not the worſe.</p>

                     <p n="6">6. The uſe of land is ſeparable from the propriety, ſo that he who payes rent for it, payes rent for that which is another mans, but hee who payes rent for money, payes rent for that which is his owne, the property being his, and he bearing all the hazard, yet (which is ſtrange) the Vſurer for his 100 l, will have 81 yearely, which 100 l in land, will not give above 5l yearely.</p>

THen laſtly woe to ſuch who through pride, ſelfe-love, and diſcontent, run out of, forſake and leave thoſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular places and ſelect ſtations wherein Chriſt our Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hath ſetled them to war this good warfare.</p>
                  <p>Miſtake me not, I pray, as if I thought or taught it altogether, and abſolutely unlawfull to divert from this or that particular calling: for changes may lawfully be made, otherwiſe <hi>Amos</hi> an heardſman by calling had never beene a Prophet, <hi>Amos</hi> 7. 14. Chriſts Diſciples who were fiſhermen, and of ſuch like oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupations had never beene Apoſtles. <hi>Mar. 1. 18. David</hi> had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come from the ſheephooke to the Scepter.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Change of callings upon private neceſſity, when a man cannot by his calling maintaine himſelfe and thoſe who rely and depend upon him, is I thinke approved of by Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> practiſe, who herewith enforced, returned to tent-making, not relinquiſhing the other of more excellency, weight and importance.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Change of callings for the weale-publique and a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good, to benefit more the Church and Common-wealth is not to be diſproved, contradicted or condemned, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable: as for a private man to become a Magiſtrate, this being warranted by <hi>Moſes</hi> leaving <hi>Iethrees</hi> ſheepe to governe and conduct the Iſraelites.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. For a man utterly and altogether diſabled by want of guifts, and abilities, by incurable diſcaſes or the like, to leave
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:13975:191"/> and forſake his calling, is I take it not to be diſallowed of and diſcommended, for even <hi>Moſes</hi> diſabled through old age re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned his office to <hi>Ioſhuah, Deut.</hi> 31. 2, 7.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 For a man legally depoſed, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 44. 13. or having ſuch a calling which is impoſed for a certaine ſeaſon onely, theſe muſt reſigne according to the appointment and will of ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our powers.</p>
                  <p>But as in the field for ſouldiers to leave and forſake their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and ſtandings at their owne will and liking, without the will and warrant of their Captaines and Commanders. 1 Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth much ſtubborneneſſe, pride, diſobedience and rebellion. 2 Is a meanes and occaſion to diſranke and diſorder the whole hoſt and army. 3 Diſioynts and diſſevers each from other, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing themſelves and others to ruine and overthrowe: ſo in this our Chriſtian warfare, for men who by profeſſion are Chriſts ſervants and ſouldiers, and by him ranked in ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſtations and ſtandings, without good warrant from the good will and pleaſure of God, meerely upon their owne wills and liking, for the attainement of greater wealth, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and preferment, or to live more idly, lazily and unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably. 1 Argues much diſobedience and diſloyalty. 2 Is a meanes to diſorder the Church and Common-wealth. 3 And to expoſe themſelves and others what in them lyeth to ruine and deſtruction: as for example,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For Miniſters of Gods Word through idleneſſe, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe, fearefullneſſe or other ſinfull and ſiniſter reſpects, by ends and aimes <hi>Demas</hi>-like to forſake the Goſpell, and their profeſſion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For decayed and decrepit ſerving men or tradeſmen to creepe into the Miniſtery for living ſake, for although the change is to the better and more excellent eſtate and calling, yet how can theſe more glorifie God, and bring greater bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to the Church and Common-wealth (which men muſt aime at in change of callings) theſe wanting gifts if not of nature, yet of art and learning to do the ſame.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. For idle diſcontented people to part with farmes and livings to be Vſurers or Maulſters. The former of which being
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:13975:192"/> generally and groundedly condemned as unlawfull and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable. And as for the latter although the commodity they deale withall be neceſſary and uſefull in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; and although the diſorderly and diſſolute drunkenneſſe of theſe times makes theſe manner of men to multiply, &amp; grow rich, yet whether this be a calling allowed by our State, or whether it is warrantable for a man wholly to apply himſelfe unto the ſame (this being as I take it an appertinent appendix belonging to the husbandman, who by this ſort of people is much abridged, and abbreviated of one of his maine commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities to his diſadvantage and diſcouragement (and yet hee ought to have all manner of countenancing, and fitting reſpect the King himſelfe being ſerved by the field, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 5. 9.) to the enriching, and advancing of men uſually idle if not licentious, I much doubt.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. For men whoſe trayning up hath beene in husbandry, or in ſome other honeſt and commendable arts or callings, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the ſame through love of idleneſſe, and for ſuch other ſinfull reſpects to turne ale-houſe-keepers. For although ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily there muſt be houſes of reſort and receipt for travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers and traffiquers: although the exceſſive and extraordinary extravagant exorbitances too much abounding and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing in ſuch places, by meanes of the ſuperabundant and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary number of theſe kinde of people, and the diſſolute diſpoſitions of the moſt of them are rather the faults of the perſons then of the places: although men may bee honeſt (though with much difficulty theſe having not meane, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny temptations to innumerable inconveniences) in this trade of life, and it were to be wiſhed that none but honeſt, well qualified, and conditioned men might bee tolerated unto the ſame: yet for men to relinquiſh and renounce other courſes of life and callings, far more needfull to the Common-wealth, and more free unto themſelves, that they may live epicure-like, idly, and unprofitably, cannot but bee condemned as ſhamefull and ſinfull.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. For men whoſe education and breeding hath beene to the needle, ſhuttle, anvile, or other inferiour yet commendable
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:13975:192"/> Chriſtian and laudable kinds of living, out of a diſdaine of the baſenes of theſe callings, ſelf-conceitednes of their own worth &amp; wit to work wonders, &amp; to mannage matters of greater im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, out of a deſire to grow great, to gaine wealth, and get preferment, or to live more idly, and eaſily: for theſe men to forſake theſe callings to turne graſiers, and husbandmen is not in my apprehenſion warrantable; and to my knowledge uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attended with ſad ſucceſſes, with evill, unlook'd for, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welcome events.</p>
                  <p>Although therfore there is nothing more common (I ſuppoſe I may ſay dangerous alſo) among mortall men then to beleeve and beare themſelves in hand that the eſtate of others is farre more beneficiall and better then their own: we being througly acquainted with the divers diſheartening, and diſadvantageous diſcommodities of our own callings, little or not at all ſeene into, or perceiving the ſame in other mens.</p>
                  <p>Although male-contented, yea the moſt of mortall men are continually complayning, ſeldome content, never ſatisfied, but alwaies deſirous to change their condition and exchange their eſtates, ſo that the ſhepheard would be a husbandman, the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman a gentleman, the gentleman a ſquire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Little conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that this is no ſmall cauſe of great decayes in Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths, that dry and withered oakes and ſhrubs which have beene nouriſhed upon the ſharp and craggy mountaines would ſeeme to be dainty date trees cheriſhed in pleaſant gardens. Yet beloved brethren and fellow Chriſtian ſouldiers, let us perſiſt in, and piouſly practiſe the duties of our perſonall and particular callings without fainting, or forſaking them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Conſidering that as there is no kind of life in the world but therin vile, and wicked men may ſlander their perſons, and looſe their ſoules: ſo there is no ſtate or ſtation in the Church of God but men may therin (if they will) ſerve God, profit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and others: for as the ſtate of Princes and of other prime men having precedency, predominance, preheminence, and prerogatives is good if they abuſe it not: ſo is the eſtate of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of inferious rankes and orders if they behave themſelves dutifully, and obediently. As the condition of rich men is good
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:13975:193"/> if they do graciouſly and godlily uſe the ſame, ſo is that of the poore alſo if they have piety and patience.

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Conſidering that during the time of our miſerable mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, our limber and languiſhing life in every condition and calling there is both trouble and danger.</p>
                  <p n="3">3.
